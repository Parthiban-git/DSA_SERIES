tree:
    non-linear ds
    linear-one level nonlinear--> hirarchial
    basically a undirected graph

    height--> no of edges from that node to leaf(in longest path)
    depth-->length of path from root to that node


binary tree :
         node contains at most 2 children (0,1,2) not more than that
         basically it acts like a doubly linked list
         a node contains data, left child address, right child address
full/proper/strict
         each node contains 0 or 2 children
         ie()each node contains 2 children except leaf

complete binary tree:
         each levels are completely filled eacept last levels
         last level is filled from as left as possible

perfect binary tree:
        each node contains 2 node except for leaf
        all leaf must be at same level

degenerate binary tree:
        each internal node contains one child
        left skewed or right skewed binary tree
